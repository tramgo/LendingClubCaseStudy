# Loan Data Analysis
> This repository contains an analysis of loan data with the aim of identifying factors that influence loan default rates. The analysis includes data cleaning, univariate and bivariate statistical methods to explore the relationships between various loan attributes and the likelihood of default.

## General Information
- This project involves a case study of loan data from the Lending Club to identify factors that contribute to the risk of loan default.
- The background involves understanding the financial factors that can predict the risk associated with lending money to individuals.
- The business problem addressed by this project is the identification of patterns and correlations that can inform lending decisions and risk assessment.
- The dataset used comprises loan data including loan amounts, interest rates, employment length, and other financial attributes of borrowers.

## Conclusions
The analysis indicates that while no single factor predicts default, a combination of high loan amounts, higher interest rates, longer loan terms, higher credit utilization, and a history of delinquency are associated with higher default rates. These insights can help refine risk assessment and loan approval processes.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
